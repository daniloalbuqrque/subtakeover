### created by dawn (me)
#
### - usage:

1. `./subtakeover.sh [ -a ] [ example.com ]`  ->  the flag `-a` will bring the subdomains list (you have to edit the code and add the name into it) to find subdomains with some alias to any cloud or host (AWS, Azure, GCP, and others.);

### - ifs...

- if you guys want to talk to me about the code, send me a direct message.
- if you want to help implementing the code I suggest to clone it by SSH and make a pull request, I promess that I will gladly review all of them.
- if you guys see any error in the code, please, get it correct, ASAP.
